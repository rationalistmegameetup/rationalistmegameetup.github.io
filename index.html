<h1>East Coast Rationalist Megameetup 2017</h1>

<p><strong>TL;DR: We’re putting together a weekend-long gathering of rationalist
community people in NYC for Solstice weekend. If you want in,
<a href="#register">register below</a>.</strong></p>

<p>As you might already know, <a
href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1939801081/nyc-secular-solstice-2017-generations"
target="_blank">the seventh annual Secular Solstice celebration</a> is
happening this year in New York City on December 9. This means we’ll have a
whole bunch of people from the rationalist community all in town for the same
weekend.</p>

<p>Since many of us need a place to stay anyway, we’re renting a big house
together in Astoria, Queens, and using that as the central gathering place, like
at Highgarden in 2014. This way we’ll get to spend the weekend hanging out
together, with more flexibility to do things than if we all had to wander around
looking for a public space.</p>

<p>Besides Solstice and the afterparty, the big activity will be an unconference
on Sunday. We’ll also have a ritual lab, games, meals together, and whatever
other activities you want to run! There'll also be plenty of room for
unstructured socializing, of course.</p>

<p><strong>Registration for sleeping over is now closed.</strong> The house is
at capacity. Thanks to everyone who registered! <a

>Contact the organizer</a> if you’d like to be put on the waitlist.</p>

<p>Registration is still open if you just want to hang out with us during the
day. It costs $25 per person, primarily to cover food (at least three meals
throughout the weekend). Solstice tickets are also not included; if you don’t
already have one from the Kickstarter, you can get one on <a
