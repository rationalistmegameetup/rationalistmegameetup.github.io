<h1>No-Sleepover Registration for East Coast Rationalist Megameetup 2017</h1>

<p>If you want to be guaranteed a spot at the Megameetup (assuming it goes
forward) but don’t intend to sleep at the Airbnb location, register here
(instead of with the <a href="/#register">main form</a>) by October 30. You’ll
be asked for a $75 authorization (instead of $125), and on October 30 you’ll be
charged half as much for the rental as participants who’ll be sleeping over,
plus the $25 for other expenses.</p>

<p>Please be aware that after October 30, participants who aren’t sleeping over
will be allowed to register for only $25—but only if there’s room for them in
the location that’s already been rented. By registering here and now at the
higher price, you ensure that there’ll be a space for you.</p>
